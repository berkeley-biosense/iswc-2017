abstract = {A low-cost, consumer-grade, EEG-based individual authentication system is proposed in this work. While EEG signals are recorded, the subject performs four mental imagery tasks consisting of a baseline measurement, referential limb movement, counting, and rotation for 150 seconds each. The 150 seconds of data are divided into one second segments, from which features are obtained. Three sets of features are extracted from each electrode: 6th order autoregressive (AR) coefficients, power spectral density, and total power in five frequency bands. Two additional sets of features are extracted from interhemispheric data: interhemispheric power differences and interhemispheric linear complexity. These feature sets are combined into a feature vector that is then used by a linear support vector machine (SVM) with cross validation for classification. The goal was to minimize both false accept rates (FARs) and false reject rates (FRRs). Using voting rules across groups of ten segments, we were able to achieve 100{\%} classification accuracy for each subject in each task. Though more work must be done with a larger subject pool as well as across multiple sessions, these results show that low-cost EEG authentication systems may be viable.},

abstract = {Cryptographic systems often rely on the secrecy of cryptographic keys given to users. Many schemes, however, cannot resist coercion attacks where the user is forcibly asked by an attacker to reveal the key. These attacks, known as rubber hose cryptanalysis, are often the easiest way to defeat cryptography. We present a defense against coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. We use a carefully crafted computer game to plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. While the planted secret can be used for authentication, the participant cannot be coerced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious knowledge of it. We performed a number of user studies using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to verify that participants can successfully reauthenticate over time and that they are unable to reconstruct or even recognize short fragments of the planted secret.},

BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) have many applica- tions, however the dissemination of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding “ideal” diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested – the former with aworkload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300 speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board – or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip – could be an effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be suitable for popularizing BCI uses.},

The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results. An approach to feature selection based on genetic algorithms is also presented with preliminary results of application to EEG during finger movement.},

EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic and we believe that it may open new research directions and applications in the future. However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Maximum A Posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session. We perform intensive experimental simulations using several strict train/test protocols to show the potential of our method. We also show that there are some mental tasks that are more appropriate for person authentication than others.},

abstract = {A method for measuring electroencephalograms (EEG) from the outer ear, so-called ear-EEG, has recently been proposed. The method could potentially enable robust recording of EEG in natural environments. The objective of this study was to substantiate the ear-EEG method by using a larger population of subjects and several paradigms. For rigor, we considered simultaneous scalp and ear-EEG recordings with common reference. More precisely, 32 conventional scalp electrodes and 12 ear electrodes allowed a thorough comparison between conventional and ear electrodes, testing several different placements of references. The paradigms probed auditory onset response, mismatch negativity, auditory steady-state response and alpha power attenuation. By comparing event related potential (ERP) waveforms from the mismatch response paradigm, the signal measured from the ear electrodes was found to reflect the same cortical activity as that from nearby scalp electrodes. It was also found that referencing the ear-EEG electrodes to another within-ear electrode affects the time-domain recorded waveform (relative to scalp recordings), but not the timing of individual components. It was furthermore found that auditory steady-state responses and alpha-band modulation were measured reliably with the ear-EEG modality. Finally, our findings showed that the auditory mismatch response was difficult to monitor with the ear-EEG. We conclude that ear-EEG yields similar performance as conventional EEG for spectrogram-based analysis, similar timing of ERP components, and equal signal strength for sources close to the ear. Ear-EEG can reliably measure activity from regions of the cortex which are located close to the ears, especially in paradigms employing frequency-domain analyses.},

In this study, autoregressive coefficients, channel spectral powers, inter-hemispheric channel spectral power differences, inter-hemispheric channel linear complexity and non-linear complexity (approximate entropy) values were used as EEG features by the two-stage authentication method with a modified four fold cross validation procedure. The results indicated that perfect accuracy was obtained, i.e. the FRE and FAE were both zero when the proposed method was tested on five subjects using certain thought activities. This initial study has shown that the combination of the two-stage authentication method with EEG features from thought activities has good potential as a biometric as it is highly resistant to fraud. However, this is only a pilot type of study and further extensive research with more subjects would be necessary to establish the suitability of the proposed method for biometric applications.},

abstract = {The reliable operation of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) signals requires accurate classification of multichannel EEG. The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results. An approach to feature selection based on genetic algorithms is also presented with preliminary results of application to EEG during finger movement.},

@article{Poulos2002,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper focusses on the person identification problem based on features extracted from the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). A bilinear rather than a purely linear model is fitted on the EEG signal, prompted by the existence of non-linear components in the EEG signal--a conjecture already investigated in previous research works. The novelty of the present work lies in the comparison between the linear and the bilinear results, obtained from real field EEG data, aiming towards identification of healthy subjects rather than classification of pathological cases for diagnosis. METHODS: The EEG signal of a, in principle, healthy individual is processed via (non)linear (AR, bilinear) methods and classified by an artificial neural network classifier. RESULTS: Experiments performed on real field data show that utilization of the bilinear model parameters as features improves correct classification scores at the cost of increased complexity and computations. Results are seen to be statistically significant at the 99.5{\%} level of significance, via the chi 2 test for contingency. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study further corroborate existing research, which shows evidence that the EEG carries individual-specific information, and that it can be successfully exploited for purposes of person identification and authentication.},

abstract = {We present a novel idea for user authentication that we call pass-thoughts. Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology indicate that there is potential for a new type of human-computer interaction: a user transmitting thoughts directly to a computer. The goal of a pass-thought system would be to extract as much entropy as possible from a user's brain signals upon "transmitting" a thought. Provided that these brain signals can be recorded and processed in an accurate and repeatable way, a pass-thought system might provide a quasi two-factor, changeable, authentication method resistant to shoulder-surfing. The potential size of the space of a pass-thought system would seem to be unbounded in theory, although in practice it will be finite due to system constraints. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and potential of pass-thought authentication, the status quo of BCI technology, and outline the design of what we believe to be a currently feasible pass-thought system. We also briefly mention the need for general exploration and open debate regarding ethical considerations for such technologies.},
